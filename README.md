This was my final project for my first semester at college. It's a fully responsive single-page website built from scratch using HTML and CSS.

## About This Project

I created this website for a fictional media company called "Three Star Media." The assignment was to build a mobile-first responsive website that adapts seamlessly from mobile devices to desktop screens. This was one of my first real projects where I had to put together everything I learned about HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and Grid.

## What I Built

- A complete single-page website with navigation, hero section, about, services, team, and contact sections
- Mobile-first design that transforms into a desktop layout at 760px
- Used CSS Flexbox for the navigation and team sections
- Used CSS Grid for the services section layout
- Fully responsive design with a max-width of 1200px for content
- Integrated Google Fonts (Open Sans) and Font Awesome icons

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid)
- Google Fonts
- Font Awesome Icons

## Key Features

- **Responsive Navigation:** Mobile menu that transforms into a horizontal nav on desktop
- **Hero Section:** Full-width background image with overlay text
- **Services Grid:** Dynamic grid layout that adapts to screen size
- **Team Section:** Alternating layout for team members on desktop
- **Contact Form:** Includes form inputs, hours of operation table, and embedded Google Map

## What I Learned

This project really helped me understand how to structure a responsive website properly. I learned about:
- The importance of mobile-first design
- How to use wrapper classes to create full-width "bleed" backgrounds while keeping content constrained
- Managing CSS with proper organization and commenting
- Using Flexbox and Grid together in the same project
- Media queries and responsive breakpoints
